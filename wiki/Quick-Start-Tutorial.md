## 🎯 Pro Tips for New Users

### Safety First
- ✅ **Always run as administrator** for full functionality
- ✅ **Review what's being cleaned** before confirming
- ✅ **Start with default settings** - they're safe for most users
- ✅ **Create a system backup** before major cleaning operations

### Optimization Tips
- 🔄 **Run weekly cleaning** for optimal performance
- 📊 **Use File Explorer** to identify large, unnecessary files
- 🔔 **Enable notifications** to stay informed
- 📅 **Schedule cleaning** during off-hours (night/early morning)

### Getting the Most Space Back
1. **Empty Recycle Bin regularly** - often contains large files
2. **Clean browser cache** - can grow very large over time
3. **Remove old Windows Update files** - safe and space-efficient
4. **Check temp files** - applications create temporary data

## 📊 Understanding Cleaning Categories

### Safe to Clean (Always Recommended)
- **Temporary Files**: Created by applications, safe to remove
- **Browser Cache**: Web page data, will re-download as needed
- **Thumbnail Cache**: Image previews, Windows will recreate
- **Log Files**: Application logs, usually not needed by users

### Moderate Impact (Usually Safe)
- **Recycle Bin**: Permanently deletes items, make sure you don't need them
- **System Cache**: May slow some operations initially
- **Error Reports**: Microsoft crash data, safe unless debugging

### Consider Carefully
- **Windows Update Files**: Prevents rolling back recent updates
- **Large Applications**: Use File Explorer to identify and manually review

## 🚨 What to Do If Something Goes Wrong

### Application Won't Start
- **Run as administrator** - right-click icon → "Run as administrator"
- **Check Windows version** - requires Windows 10 (1903+) or Windows 11
- **Restart computer** and try again

### Cleaning Seems Slow
- **This is normal** for first-time use with lots of files
- **Don't interrupt** the cleaning process
- **Be patient** - large caches take time to analyze and clean

### Can't Find Freed Space
- **Check Recycle Bin** - some cleaners move files here first
- **Restart computer** - Windows may need to update disk usage
- **Run Disk Cleanup** - Windows built-in tool for additional cleaning

### Scheduled Cleaning Not Working
- **Check Task Scheduler** - Windows → Task Scheduler → WindowsCleanerPro_AutoClean
- **Verify time settings** - ensure computer is on at scheduled time
- **Check user permissions** - scheduled tasks need proper privileges
